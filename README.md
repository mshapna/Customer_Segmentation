# Customer_Segmentation

Classification jobs with more than two class or types of labels are classified as multi-class classification. Multiclass classification in machine learning, is different from binary classification since involves many classes or labels.Classification problems having multiple classes with an imbalanced dataset poses various challenges unlike binary classification problem.

A classification task with more than two classes; e.g., classify a set of fruits using gas sensors which may be oranges, apples, or pears. Multi-class classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label: a fruit can be either an apple or a pear but not both at the same time.

Common examples include image classification (is it a cat, dog, human, etc) or handwritten digit recognition (classifying an image of a handwritten number into a digit from 0 to 9).

Multiclass classification should not be confused with multi-label classification. In multi-label classification, we have several labels that are the outputs for a given prediction. When making predictions, a given input may belong to more than one label. For example, when predicting a given movie category, it may belong to horror, romance, adventure, action, or all simultaneously.

Multi-Class Classification Problem

An automobile company has plans to enter new market with their existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5). After intensive market research, theyâ€™ve deduced that the behavior of new market is similar to their existing market.

In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for different segment of customers. This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy on new markets and have identified 2627 new potential customers.

We are required to help the manager to predict the right group for the new customers.

Multi-Class Classification Algorithms

In this notebook, we are going to use One vs Rest(OvR) and One vs One(OvO) algorithms to solve the problem.

Further, we we will use the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to solve the same problem, click here to see

Finally, we will use the k-NN and Naive Bayes algorithms to solve the same customer segmentation problem.
